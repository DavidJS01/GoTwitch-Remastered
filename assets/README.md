## What is Go-Twitch Analytics?
Go-Twitch is a self-service, containerized solution to aggregating and visualizing Twitch chat data in near-real time.

Go-Twitch is a rewrite of my first data engineering Python project, but written in Go (with more elaborate technology).

Users can go into the web-app (WIP) and select their own list of Twitch chat streams to aggregate those messages before having those messages analyzed, visualizing the data in near real-time.
